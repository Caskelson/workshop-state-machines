# Workshop: Knowing your State Machines

The *symfony* branch uses the Workflow component.

## Run

Install with
```
composer install
bin/console doctrine:database:create
bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force
```

Make sure your database DSN is correct in `.env`. (Override them if you like by creating `.env.local`)

### Notes

**This "Notes" section is just an FYI. Start with Exercise 1 now.**

If you update the workflow configuration, you will need to regenerate the
SVG by running the following command:

```
# For the traffic light
bin/console app:build:svg state_machine.traffic_light
# For the article
bin/console app:build:svg workflow.article
```

#### Extra requirements

To be able to dump workflows you need to install [Graphwiz](http://www.graphviz.org/)

#### Updates to database

If you update your models (files in `App\Entity`) you need to update your database.
That is done with DoctrineMigrations.

```
# Create migration files:
bin/console doctrine:migration:diff

# Execute the files
bin/console doctrine:migration:migrate
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

Configure a new state machine using a new `App\Workflow\TrafficLightFactory`. This class
should be used as a [service factory](https://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container/factories.html).
You should create a new service named `state_machine.traffic_light_php` using this factory.

```yaml
state_machine.traffic_light_php:
    public: true
    class: Symfony\Component\Workflow\StateMachine
    factory: [App\Workflow\TrafficLightFactory, create]
```

Create a workflow that looks like this:

The [this section of Symfony documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/workflow.html) might be helpful here.

### Exercise 2

Do the same thing as **Exercise 1** but use Symfony Yaml config.

```yaml
framework:
  workflows:
    traffic_light:
      # ...
```

The [this section of Symfony documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/workflow.html#creating-a-workflow) might be helpful here.

Note: Instead of Yaml you may use the PHP ConfigBuilder:

```php
use Symfony\Config\FrameworkConfig;

return static function (FrameworkConfig $framework) {
    $trafficLight = $framework->workflows()->workflows('traffic_light');

    // ...
}
```

### Exercise 3

Dump the state machines to make sure the configuration is correct.
Use one of the following commands:

(replace "NAME" with the name of your workflow/state machine)

```bash
php bin/console workflow:dump NAME | dot -Tpng -o workflow.png
php bin/console workflow:dump NAME --dump-format=puml | java -jar plantuml.jar -p  > workflow.png
```

Example:

```bash
bin/console workflow:dump traffic_light_php | dot -Tpng -o php.png
bin/console workflow:dump traffic_light     | dot -Tpng -o yaml.png
```

Now look at the file just created file "php.png" and "yaml.png.

### Exercise 4

Implement an event subscriber for your state machine that logs all transitions.

See it live:
```
symfony serve
# or
# php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 -t public
```

1. Go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
2. Select "TrafficLight"
3. Create a TrafficLight object
4. Move around the states using the buttons.

### Exercise 5

Implement an event subscriber that blocks an transition. Make sure only admins
(ROLE_ADMIN) can execute that transition.

### Exercise 6

Take a look at the `PullRequest` class and the `PullRequestController`. It is
clearly a workflow here.

1. Try to draw that workflow on a paper?
2. Make a change to your workflow
3. Could you make that same change to the code?
4. (optional) Refactor the `PullRequest` class and the `PullRequestController` to make it use
a state machine or a workflow.
5. (optional) Try to apply the same change (from bullet 2.) to your new implementation.


### Exercise 7

Look at the `SignupController`. It is currently 4 steps to signup. That is a business
requirement so we cannot change that. The business requires you to change the order
of the steps.

1. See how the signup curretly works by visiting: http://127.0.0.1:8000/signup/start
2. Refactor the `SignupController` to use a workflow
3. Make sure we cannot "skip" a step by hacking the URLs
4. Make sure we use the workflow for `redirectToRoute`. (Use metadata on the workflow)


Example of using metadata:
```yaml
framework:
  workflows:
    signup:
       # ....
      places:
        name:
          metadata:
            route: signup_name
```

### Exercise 8

We now know our way around the Workflow component and all the events it is dispatching.
On a real application this could quickly grow very big. If you are using the
[Messenger component](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/messenger.html) you may
find it strange that there are two kinds of "event dispatchers". One set of events and listeners
for the workflow and one set for the Messenger.

To make our application less complex we decided to implement a custom EventDispatcher for
our Workflow. That dispatcher should forward some events to a message bus and then ignore the
rest.

1. Run `composer req messenger`
2. Create `App\Workflow\EventDispatcher`
3. How to inject this event dispatcher to our existing `state_machine.traffic_light`?
4. How do we handle guard events? Why are they a problem?

### Bonus exercise 1

A defensive programmer would say that a workflow is no place for adding metadata. That is
outside the concern of the workflow and should be handled elsewhere.

Do Exercise 7 again but without metadata. You may introduce a new service which will give
you the route for a specific state. Try to make that class reusable for multiple services.

### Bonus exercise 2

Create a Guard event listener. In that listener, make a HTTP call to somewhere. (In a real
application you may make an HTTP call to your own API) Debug the application to see when
this HTTP call is executed. Could we see any side effects here?

### Bonus exercise 3

A Domain Driven Design enthusiast would like to use the workflow component but they want
the states to be defined in their object. How can they go about to solve this?

### Bonus exercise 4

You are working with a highly advanced CRM system. You want the users to define the workflow
for different objects themselves. How can we create such system with the Symfony workflow component?

### Bonus exercise 5

Symfony 4.3 introduced `$context` on the `apply()` function. So you can pass some data from
the caller of the `apply()` to the objects `setMarking()` function.

Your task is to implement that and make sure it works.

Question: Could you imagine how this context could be abused?

### Bonus exercise 6

What does the `AuditTrail` feature do? How does it work? Is that a feature of the Workflow component?

### Bonus exercise 7

When should you use the `Registry` class? When should you not use it?

### Bonus exercise 8

What is a `TransitionBlockerList`. How and when is it used? What issue does it solve?


### Bonus exercise 9

What is the difference between the following events:

- workflow.enter
- workflow.entered
- workflow.completed
- workflow.announce

### Bonus exercise 10

Events are dispatched in a specific order. Example:

- workflow.leave
- workflow.[name].leave
- workflow.[name].leave.[place]

It goes from generic to specific. Is the order important? Can we reverse the order?
Should we reverse the order?

### Bonus exercise 11

You want to over optimize your application by reducing the number of lines of code
executed. How would you tell Symfony not to dispatch so many events?
